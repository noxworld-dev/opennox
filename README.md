### Release
All release builds are made from the `dev` branch. Recent OpenNox releases can be found [here](<https://github.com/noxworld-dev/opennox/releases>).

Linux releases are also available in `stable` channel of our [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/opennox).

### Nightly
On each commit, an automated build of the `dev` branch is uploaded.
These builds contain all the latest merged features, but are not yet considered stable for release.
These builds are to help provide an insight to what the next release will contain and should only be used for active playtesting purposes **only**.

Linux nightly builds are also available in `edge` channel of our [Snap package](https://snapcraft.io/opennox).
