# Tweaking game balance

Vanilla Nox stores game balance values in an encoded `gamedata.bin` file.

OpenNox additionally allows overriding values in that file with the ones written in a text-based `gamedata.yml` file.

To try it out, copy [gamedata-sample.yml](gamedata-sample.yml) to Nox game directory (not OpenNox directory!)
and rename it to `gamedata.yml`. After this, you can edit it via any text editor (Notepad++ on Windows is advised).
